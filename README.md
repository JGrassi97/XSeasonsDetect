# XSeasonsDetect

`XSeasonDetect` is a Python tool designed for the detection and analysis of meteorological and climatological seasons, designed to be compatible with [`xarray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html).

The tool is built upon a Machine Learning algorithm proposed by A. J Cannon in  the article [Defining climatological seasons using radially constrained clustering](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005GL023410) (2005).
